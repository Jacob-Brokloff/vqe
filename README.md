A simple Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) program. This utilizes IBMs Qiskit.
  - This is a simple 2 qubit system
  - You can edit the input in main.py to expand this if you want

You can run this locally with the Aersimulator, or you can input your API
  -   Edit these 2 parameters in vqe/config/ibm.py
  -   IBM_API_KEY  = "" 
  -   IBM_INSTANCE = "" 

If you want to run the program just run this executable file in bash
  -   ./run.sh
  -   I diagram showing the final values will pop up as a pdf in your browser
  -   Please keep in mind that this script will create a virtual environment, and install any dependencies you don't have. Please be careful.
